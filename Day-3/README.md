## Day 3 - Design library cell using Magic Layout and ngspice characterization


### Theory

### Implementation

* Day 3 tasks:-
1. Clone custom inverter standard cell design from github repository: [Standard cell design and characterization using OpenLANE flow](https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign).
2. Load the custom inverter layout in magic and explore.
3. Spice extraction of inverter in magic.
4. Editing the spice model file for analysis through simulation.
5. Post-layout ngspice simulations.
6. Find problem in the DRC section of the old magic tech file for the skywater process and fix them.


#### 1. Clone custom inverter standard cell design from github repository

```bash
# Change directory to openlane
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# Clone the repository with custom inverter design
git clone https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign

# Change into repository directory
cd vsdstdcelldesign

# Copy magic tech file to the repo directory for easy access
cp /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech .

# Check contents whether everything is present
ls

# Command to open custom inverter layout in magic
magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_inv.mag &
```

#### 2. Load the custom inverter layout in magic and explore.

#### 3. Spice extraction of inverter in magic.

Commands for spice extraction of the custom inverter layout to be used in tkcon window of magic

```tcl
# Check current directory
pwd

# Extraction command to extract to .ext format
extract all

# Before converting ext to spice this command enable the parasitic extraction also
ext2spice cthresh 0 rthresh 0

# Converting to ext to spice
ext2spice
```

#### 4. Editing the spice model file for analysis through simulation.

#### 5. Post-layout ngspice simulations.

Commands for ngspice simulation

```bash
# Command to directly load spice file for simulation to ngspice
ngspice sky130_inv.spice

# Now that we have entered ngspice with the simulation spice file loaded we just have to load the plot
plot y vs time a
```

Rise transition time calculation

```math
Rise\ transition\ time = Time\ taken\ for\ output\ to\ rise\ to\ 80\% - Time\ taken\ for\ output\ to\ rise\ to\ 20\%
```
```math
20\%\ of\ output = 660\ mV
```
```math
80\%\ of\ output = 2.64\ V
```

```

Fall transition time calculation

```math
Fall\ transition\ time = Time\ taken\ for\ output\ to\ fall\ to\ 20\% - Time\ taken\ for\ output\ to\ fall\ to\ 80\%
```
```math
20\%\ of\ output = 660\ mV
```

Rise Cell Delay Calculation

```math
Rise\ Cell\ Delay = Time\ taken\ for\ output\ to\ rise\ to\ 50\% - Time\ taken\ for\ input\ to\ fall\ to\ 50\%
```
```math
50\%\ of\ 3.3\ V = 1.65\ V

#### 6. Find problem in the DRC section of the old magic tech file for the skywater process and fix them.

Link to Sky130 Periphery rules: [https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/rules/periphery.html](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/rules/periphery.html)

Commands to download and view the corrupted skywater process magic tech file and associated files to perform drc corrections

```bash
# Change to home directory
cd

# Command to download the lab files
wget http://opencircuitdesign.com/open_pdks/archive/drc_tests.tgz

# Since lab file is compressed command to extract it
tar xfz drc_tests.tgz

cd drc_tests

# List all files and directories present in the current directory
ls -al

# Command to view .magicrc file
gvim .magicrc
